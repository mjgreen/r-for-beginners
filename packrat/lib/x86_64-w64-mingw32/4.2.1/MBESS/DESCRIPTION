Description: Implements methods that are useful in designing research
    studies and analyzing data, with particular emphasis on methods
    that are developed for or used within the behavioral, educational,
    and social sciences (broadly defined). That being said, many of the
    methods implemented within MBESS are applicable to a wide variety
    of disciplines. MBESS has a suite of functions for a variety of
    related topics, such as effect sizes, confidence intervals for
    effect sizes (including standardized effect sizes and noncentral
    effect sizes), sample size planning (from the accuracy in parameter
    estimation [AIPE], power analytic, equivalence, and minimum-risk
    point estimation perspectives), mediation analysis, various
    properties of distributions, and a variety of utility functions.
    MBESS (pronounced 'em-bes') was originally an acronym for 'Methods
    for the Behavioral, Educational, and Social Sciences,' but MBESS
    became more general and now contains methods applicable and used in
    a wide variety of fields and is an orphan acronym, in the sense
    that what was an acronym is now literally its name. MBESS has
    greatly benefited from others, see

    of those that have contributed and other details.
